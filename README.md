# MyClaw3D

MyClaw3D is an isometric 3D agent workspace built with React + Three.js.
It combines local in-world animations (movement, desk/sofa/sports activities) with real AI chat through an OpenClaw gateway.

## What Changed Recently

- Expanded the world with additional activity zones and richer movement/activity loops.
- Added HQ operational surfaces: Inbox, History, Playbooks, Observe.
- Added dedicated Docs, Tools, Settings, and Tasks & Notes modals.
- Added local API server endpoints for chat, streaming chat, tool invocation, events, inbox, playbooks, and agent settings.
- Added per-agent OpenClaw mapping + model routing, plus connection health checks.
- Added server-side persistence under `server/.data` for playbooks, events, inbox, and agent settings.

## Core Features

- Interactive isometric world with multiple rooms and animated agents.
- 6 role-based agents with local behaviors and AI chat.
- Live desk terminals, wall chart screens, monitor modal.
- HQ control surfaces: Inbox, History, Playbooks, Observe.
- Operator tooling: Tools modal (quick skills + raw tool invoke), Settings modal (agent routing/model), Tasks & Notes modal (task runs + artifacts).
- OpenClaw integration for streamed chat and tool invocation.

## Chat Command Examples

Command support depends on the current chat parser in `src/components/ClawHQ.jsx`, but typical local behavior commands include:

- go to desk / work
- relax / sofa / chill
- cafeteria / cafe / coffee / snack / lunch
- gym / workout / exercise
- treadmill / elliptical / bike / chest press / bench press / squat rack / punching bag / kettlebell / dumbbell / barbell / trampoline
- play ping pong
- play pool / billiards
- stand up / stop

Normal conversational prompts are routed to OpenClaw and streamed back into chat + desk terminal views.

## Dashboard & Ops Surfaces

- Inbox: queued summaries and run outputs.
- History: recent events and agent activity rollups.
- Playbooks: recurring automation templates and active schedules.
- Observe: live event feed with filters and per-agent stats.
- Tools: one-click skills and raw OpenClaw `/tools/invoke` proxy calls.
- Settings: per-agent OpenClaw agent ID + model mapping and connectivity test.
- Tasks & Notes: run ad-hoc tasks and keep artifacts/reports in-app.

## Proper OpenClaw Connection Setup

This app has two local processes:

1. Frontend (Vite) on port 3000
2. Local API server (Express) on port 8787

The frontend calls `/api/*`, and Vite proxies that to the local API server, which then calls OpenClaw.

### 1) Start OpenClaw Gateway

Run your OpenClaw Gateway so that the OpenAI-compatible endpoint is reachable (default expected base URL):

- `http://127.0.0.1:18789`

### 2) Set Required Environment Variables (PowerShell)

In the terminal where you will run the local API server:

```powershell
$env:OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN="your_gateway_token_here"
$env:OPENCLAW_BASE_URL="http://127.0.0.1:18789"
```

Optional routing defaults:

```powershell
$env:OPENCLAW_AGENT_ID="main"
# Optional JSON map string for agent routing
# $env:OPENCLAW_AGENT_MAP_JSON='{"alpha":"agent-a","bravo":"agent-b"}'
```

### 3) Run Local API Server

```bash
npm run server
```

### 4) Run Frontend Dev Server (new terminal)

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5) Verify Health

Open this endpoint in your browser:

- `http://127.0.0.1:8787/api/health`

You should see:

- `ok: true`
- `hasToken: true`

If `hasToken` is false, your server terminal does not have `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN` set.

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

## Architecture

```text
src/
  main.jsx
  components/
    ClawHQ.jsx

server/
  index.mjs
  .data/
    events.json
    inbox.json
    playbooks.json
    agent-settings.json
```

Key local API routes served by `server/index.mjs`:

- `/api/health`
- `/api/chat`
- `/api/chat/stream`
- `/api/tools/invoke`
- `/api/events`
- `/api/inbox`
- `/api/playbooks`
- `/api/agent-settings`
